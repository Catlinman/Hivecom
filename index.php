					Hivecom is a community based around a Teamspeak server hosted by a few cool people from all around the world.
					We're a constantly growing group open to those willing to join. The community itself is partially made up of a few others
					that generally enjoy playing games and are looking for a simple place to hang out and chat. The
					most prominent folks on the server are those of the
					<i><a href="http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=cobalt" alt="Espernet IRC">Cobalt IRC community</a></i>. Of course they
					are not all - over the time that the server was initially hosted we've also picked up friends of friends and even
					complete strangers to some. As mentioned, people from all around the world are known visitors of the server. The
					range goes from countries like New Zealand, over to all of Europe and across to North America.
					<br>

					Interested? Check out the server section for more information on how to become registered. We hope to see you amidst us!

					The Hivecom Teamspeak server is hosted over at <i><a href="http://www.fragnet.net/" alt="Fragnet">Fragnet</a></i>
					and is situated in Amsterdam. At this current point in time the server has a total of
					<?php
						if($online == TRUE) {
							echo $ts3["virtualserver_maxclients"];

						} else{
							echo 20;
						}
					?>
					slots open to anyone willing to join. Within the server there are a few specified groups of users that
					have different levels of interaction on the server.
					<br>
					<br>
					Non-registered users are restricted to the
					lobby and the one open hub while registered users and up are allowed to move as they see fit. They
					also have the option of creating their own temporary private channels which they can use to moderate
					on their own. We also have a group of moderators that keep track of what goes about on the server
					when there are no administrators in sight. They generally have the option to register new users as well as to
					kick and move any registered and non-registered user as they see fit. For more information on how to
					become registered on Hivecom, see the section further below.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are a few options for connecting to the Teamspeak server. We suggest using the <i>'Connect to Teamspeak'</i>
					button at the top of the page and then having you save the server address as a bookmark. You can however
					also connect directly using "<i>ts.hivecom.net</i>".

					Becoming registered can be done quite fast. If you are an outsider and do not know anyone
					within the Hivecom community, your best bet is to simply start a text chat with one of our
					moderators or administrators. Poking is allowed but we suggest not going overboard with it when
					trying to get someone's attention. From there on a quick introduction or hello world is
					all you should need if you were to want to become registered. The moderator or administrator
					should then ideally assign you to the registered server group allowing you to enter
					the main area of the Hivecom Teamspeak server.
					<br>
					<br>
					So, to keep the topic of becoming registered short: Ask politely. That is all you need to do.

					Hivecom also has a <i><a href="/files/hivecomskin.zip" alt="Link to the Hivecom Teamspeak skin">Teamspeak skin</a></i>
					you might want to try out. It's generally customized to fit the theme of Hivecom but it also
					works well on other Teamspeak servers. You can download the skin <i><a href="/files/hivecomskin.zip" alt="Link to the Hivecom Teamspeak skin">here</a></i>.

				<p>
					Due to the fact that this server and website is funded without any sponsoring or ads and is open to
					anyone to join and use, we encourage people to possibly donate a bit towards our yearly server costs.
					Catlinman is currently in charge of the entire server's costs meaning that any extra funds he receives
					will go towards maintaining and renewing the website and server.

					The server is mainly managed by the two server administrators:
					<i><a href="https://twitter.com/Catlinman_" alt="Catlinman">Catlinman</a></i> and
					<i><a href="https://twitter.com/Jokler" alt="Jokler">Jokler</a></i>.
					All three started hosting a server back in 2013 on a local machine. The demand for a better
					connection and a 24/7 uptime made them reconsider this small hosting plan. They later on that year went over
					to actually acquiring a dedicated Teamspeak server from
					<i><a href="http://www.fragnet.net/" alt="Fragnet">Fragnet</a></i>.
					The server and domain costs are currently being covered by Catlinman while Jokler makes sure
					that the Raspberry Pi this website is running on stays online.
					<br>
					<br>
					Hivecom wouldn't be anything without it's members though. The server has a total of about
					200 registered members and is constantly growing. We also have moderators which take over some of the client management from
					time to time. The full list of the administrators and moderators can be seen below.
