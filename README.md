# Hivecom #

This is the main repository containing the files that make up the [Hivecom website](http://hivecom.net).

This repository also includes an unofficial version of the Teamspeak 3 PHP framework located in the *lib* folder. One reason for this being that some changes have been made to it but the original code still remains; at the same time the framework is not publicly available anymore so the folder in this case acts as a mirror for the framework in itself.
