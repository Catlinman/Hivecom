# Hivecom #

This is the main repository containing the files that make up the [Hivecom website](http://hivecom.net).

The website uses the [Teamspeak 3 PHP framework](http://addons.teamspeak.com/directory/addon/integration/TeamSpeak-3-PHP-Framework.html) to interact with the actual server in certain areas of the website. In this repository and on the actual remote site the files of the framework are located in the *lib* folder which has been added to the *.gitignore* file in this repository. A complete documentation of the framework can be found over on [Planet Teamspeak](http://docs.planetteamspeak.com/ts3/php/framework/).
